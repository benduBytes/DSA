# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Journey

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repo serves as a comprehensive log of my journey through learning and mastering various data structures and algorithms. Here, you'll find the path I've followed, the resources I've used, and the algorithms that I believe are crucial for acing job interviews.

## Repository Overview

- **Learning Path**: A step-by-step guide to the resources, tutorials, and books I've used to build a strong foundation in DSA.
- **Algorithms**: Key algorithms that I've implemented, with explanations on why they are important and how they work.
- **Problem Solving**: Examples of problems I've solved using the learned algorithms, including explanations and code.
- **Interview Prep**: A section dedicated to interview-style questions, including solutions and tips.

## Learning Path

In this section, I document the path I've taken to learn data structures and algorithms. This includes:

- Books and online courses
- Practice platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.
- Famous guide paths that I have followed

## Key Algorithms

Here, I'll be posting algorithms that I feel are essential for cracking coding interviews. Each algorithm will include:

- A brief explanation of the algorithm
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Code implementation in relevant languages

## Problem Solving

This section contains problems that I've solved, categorized by data structure or algorithm type. Each problem includes:

- Problem statement
- Solution approach
- Code implementation
- Explanation of the solution

## Interview Preparation

As I prepare for job interviews, this section will include:

- Common DSA interview questions
- Solutions with explanations
- Tips and tricks for approaching each problem

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions, improvements, or want to share your own resources, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request. I'm always open to learning from others!
